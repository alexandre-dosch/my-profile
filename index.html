       Hello, I'm Alexandre and I'm 18. Since my childhood, I have always been passionate about sports, especially football and swimming. For the past two or three years, I have also developed a strong interest in films, and I really enjoy watching them. Currently, I am in my first year at IESEG Paris, and I like it very much. In the future, I hope to have an incredible job that makes me happy.

     <h2>Films</h2>
      <p>During my childhood, I used to leave the living room when my parents were watching films because I wasn’t interested in them. However, three years ago, I realized that my knowledge of cinema was quite limited. That’s why I decided to explore it, and now I have watched more than 100 films.</p>

     <h2>Books</h2>
      <p>Books have never been a passion for me; on the contrary, I used to hate them. However, now I try to be disciplined and I read every day on the train.</p>
